This is the source code for my personal portfolio website â€” a project I built to showcase my skills and experience.

About This Project
This portfolio site serves as a professional showcase and was built with a focus on modern DevOps practices:

Infrastructure as Code: I used Terraform to provision the cloud infrastructure, making the deployment scalable and repeatable.

Continuous Integration & Deployment: The site is automatically built and deployed via GitHub Actions workflows, ensuring smooth updates with every change.

Static Website: The site itself is a clean, fast, and responsive static website.

Tech Stack
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end

Terraform for infrastructure provisioning

GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation

AWS (S3, CloudFront, Route 53) for hosting and domain management
